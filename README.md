# 7034 Outreach Teleops
This is a project configured for use in android studio, if you are trying to build these to a robot through REV hardware client the path to the teleops is: 

RacerbotTeleop/TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode

Should have resources covering what I'm talking about made/linked soon! 

PS: If you are trying to make sense of the commit history, **dont**. Forking the standard FTC SDK wasn't working with gradle for some reason so I forked my FTC team's repo instead and put our outreach teleops in their place.
